= OCCA Isothermal layers: a volume budget =

== Introduction ==

This is a set of matlab and fortran routines to compute a thermal layer volume budget over a subdomain of the global ocean from the OCCA state estimate.

This package was developed by Guillaume Maze and Gael Forget at MIT (Cambridge, USA) for the ECCO group and the CLIMODE project.

== Requirement ==

To perform this analysis you'll need:
  * From the OCCA state estimate release 0 or 1 the fields: 
{{{
% THETA   | 50 |SM|degC            |Potential Temperature
% TENDT   | 50 |SM|degC/d          |Tendency of Potential Temperature
% ZADVT   | 51 |WM|degC.m^3/s      |Vertical   Advective Flux of Pot.Temp
% XADVT   | 50 |UU|degC.m^3/s      |Zonal      Advective Flux of Pot.Temp
% YADVT   | 50 |VV|degC.m^3/s      |Meridional Advective Flux of Pot.Temp
% XDIFT   | 51 |WM|degC.m^3/s      |Vertical   Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temp (Explicit part)
% ZDIFTI  | 51 |WM|degC.m^3/s      |Vertical   Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temp (Implicit part)

% GTABT   | 50 |SM|degC/s          |Tendency of Potential Temp. added by the Adams Bashforth Scheme
% GTFT    | 50 |SM|degC/s          |Tendency of Potential Temp. due to air-sea heat fluxes
% GHATT   | 51 |WM|degC.m^3/s      |Non-local transport term of KPP as a temperature flux
% DSSHT   | 51 |WM|degC.m^3/s      |Vertical flux of Pot.temp due to Sea Level Change

  These are normally defined on a 360*160*50 grid points, daily from 2003/11/1 to 2006/11/3 (1099 days). You can download OCCA here: http://www.ecco-group.org/products.htm or email Gael Forget.

  * This package. To download it, go to your working directory and type:

`svn checkout http://guillaumemaze.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OCCA/Tlayer_budget Tlayer_budget`


== Help ==

There are 2 steps in the computation. Step 1 extracts a subdomain of the Atlas, Step 2 compute the budget with a 3D interpolation of all fields.

=== Step 1 ===
Into *Tlayer_budget/step1* you have to tune the header of the function *extract_subdomain.m* to match your environment. 

Variables that need to be tuned are:
  *  *pathi*: this is where we find input fields (original theta and flux of temp. fields)
  *  *patho*: this is where we print out fields restricted to the subdomain.
  *  *subdomain*: this table defines the subdomain. It has the format:`[ixWest ixEast iySouth iyNorth izTop izBottom]`. For example: `subdomain = [122 200 90 130 1 25];` extract the Kuroshio region.

You may want to tune the subfunction *wherearewe* to match your machine.
You may also want to use a special mask for your domain of analysis. You can do so by looking at the subfunction *extract*.
