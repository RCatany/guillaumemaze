% THEMATRIX Animate a 3D plot by rotating around
%
% [] = thematrix(dAZ,nrevol)
%
% This function make a motion camera effect
% on the current 3D figure
% This "a la" MATRIX(c) camera effect makes the object
% to spin around it vertical axis.
%
% Help: If the 3D object shows different aspect ratio
%       during the movement, try to zoom out of it
%       with camzoom
