% $$$ This directory contains scripts written by Jake Gebbie for diagnosing
% $$$ subduction rates. All scripts are for offline diagnostics in MATLAB.
% $$$ 
% $$$ 
% $$$ Eulerian maps of subduction:
% $$$   diag_sann.m: Diagnose the annual subduction rate.
% $$$   diag_induction.m: Diagnose lateral induction across a surface (usually the
% $$$    mixed-layer base)
% $$$   get_mldvel.m: Interpolate the velocity field to a surface (usually the
% $$$     mixed-layer base)
% $$$   
% $$$ Water-mass diagnostics:
% $$$   To be included at a future date.
% $$$ 
% $$$ Utilities:
% $$$   mldepth.m: Calculate mixed-layer depth from the density field.
% $$$   cshift.m: A MATLAB replica of the popular Fortran function.
% $$$   integrate_for_w.m: A MATLAB rendition of the MITgcm subroutine 
% $$$     of the same name.
